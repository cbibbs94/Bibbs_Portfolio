            <p>Programming is the backbone to our modern society, without it, we would not have progressed as far as we have now in most categories of life. Science, Health, Education and just about every facet of normal living are all affected by programming in some shape form. My favorite thing about preogramming is that its a relatively new concept to humans, and yet it has integrated its way into the majority of our lives.</p>
            <p>I humbly invite you to take a journey with me as i learn this fantastic world and all of its many different languages, such as HTML, Python, C++, and so many more. </p>
